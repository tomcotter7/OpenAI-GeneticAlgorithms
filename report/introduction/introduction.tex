\chapter{Introduction}

Neuroevolution is a practice where Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are optimized by evolutionary algorithms, rather by the usual gradient-based learning algorithms. A paper by Such et al (2017, \cite{such}), states that Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are a competitive alternative for training deep neural networks for reinforcement learning. Neuroevolution can be used to train the weights of a DNN. We can test how well neuroevolution performs in reinforcement learning by using OpenAI Atari environments; in particular, Space Invaders \footnote{https://gym.openai.com/envs/SpaceInvaders-v0/}. Furthermore, due to Space Invaders immense popularity there have been other games on the Atari which one could refer to as Space Invader ``clones'', which means the basic premise of the game is to move left and right, shooting the enemies above you to gain points. Two example of this that have identical controls would be  Demon Attack \footnote{https://gym.openai.com/envs/DemonAttack-v0/} and Carnival \footnote{https://gym.openai.com/envs/Carnival-v0/}. Therefore, the question that arises is, would it be possible to train a DNN on Space Invaders and use that learning to produce a ``good'' performance on a Space Invader clone? Neuroevolution can help to solve this question as we can train the model without the need for a large labelled dataset, and we can use the final model on different enviroments.

\section{Aim of the Project}

The aim of this project is to answer the question: \textbf{Can we transfer the learning of Deep Neural Networks trained with neuroevolution techniques on one environment to another similar environment?}. This aim can broken down into some goals which are detailed here:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Train a DNN using a genetic algorithm to consistenly get high scores on Space Invaders.
  \item Use this DNN to measure the score of running it on a Space Invader clone.
  \item Measure how well the DNN performed by comparing it to other ways of selecting an action from a state.
\end{itemize}

For this project, I will be using Python to use the OpenAI enviroments, and TensorFlow to implement the DNN.
