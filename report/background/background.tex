\chapter{Related Work}

\label{ch:background}


Ok, topics I need to talk about here, I'll put them as sections

\section{Neuro-Evolution}

Probably 2/3 papers on what neuroevolution is, how it works, why it is useful, different usages of neuroevolution.

\subsection{Genetic Algorithms}

Again 1/2 papers on how genetic algorithms work.


\section{Transfer Learning}

Again, 2/3 papers on transfer learning, other uses of transfer learning, has this ever been done before (i.e transfer learning on reinforcement learning enviroments)

\section{Other Work with the OpenAI Gym environments}

Probably like 1/2 paper(s) on other achievements with the OpenAI Gym. (This section could be cut out if needed).
