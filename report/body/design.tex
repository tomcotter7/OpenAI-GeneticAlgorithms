\chapter{Design}

OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for reinforcement learning research. It includes a growing collection of benchmark problems that expose a common interface (2016, \cite{gym}). OpenAI Gym focuses on the episodic setting of reinforcement learning, where the agent's experience is broken down into a series of episodes. In each episode the agent's initial state is randomly sampled from a distribution, and the interaction proceeds until the environment reaches a terminal state. The robotics environments that are used in this project are defined using MuJoCo, a python library for advanced physisc simulation \cite{mujoco}. OpenAI Gym does not include a built-in agent, so this will have to be built from scratch.



Main section of this project would be Agent architecture (however this is relatively basic).

Also, I would need to talk about the different design choices for the evolution of the agents - selection, mutation and crossover algorithms.
