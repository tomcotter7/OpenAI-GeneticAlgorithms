"How you designed the environment and agents in order to address the question"


Perhaps I could talk about OpenAI Gym underlying implementation, but might not be neccessary, perhaps just that they use mujoco to define it - could talk about that.


Main section of this project would be Agent architecture (however this is relatively basic).

Also, I would need to talk about the different design choices for the evolution of the agents - selection, mutation and crossover algorithms.
