for the new update to the project, using this paper - https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236. This is most commonly used way to use deep learning in reinforcement learning.
Convolution, Dense and a dropout layer will be used.

We can use a stable-baselines3 function called WarpFrame, what this means is that all of the image data passed will be in the form (84,84,1)

What this means is that we can train our deep neural net on space invaders. Once we can figure out a way to get a maximum score - using mutation, crossover etc... all the different techniques.

We can test our models capabilities to transfer its learning to two space invader "clones" - DemonAttack and Carnival, the premise and controls of these games are very similar to SpaceInvaders.

Therefore, in theory the model should perform significantly better than random actions on the environment, and we can test the number of generations it takes to get the model perfect.


Neuroevolution, or neuro-evolution, is a form of artificial intelligence that uses evolutionary algorithms to generate artificial neural networks (ANN), parameters, topology and rules.[1] It is most commonly applied in artificial life, general game playing[2] and evolutionary robotics. The main benefit is that neuroevolution can be applied more widely than supervised learning algorithms, which require a syllabus of correct input-output pairs. In contrast, neuroevolution requires only a measure of a networkâ€™s performance at a task.
