# OpenAI-GeneticAlgorithms
Transfer Learning with Genetic Algorithms on OpenAIs Robotics Environments

Initially, this project was created with regular python code to be run on my own machine. This is what is contained in src/

However, due to Google's GPUs being much faster I decided to use Google Colab. The file for the colab code is neuroevolution-robotics.ipynb.

This project is about whether I can apply the knowledge learnt using neuroevolution on Deep Neural Network to multiple similar OpenAI Gym robotics environments.
